# Regular Expressions Repository

This repository contains implementations of regular expressions to match specific patterns for Twitter usernames, ISBN numbers, jokes, and weirdly formatted dates. The regular expressions are implemented in both Python and JavaScript.

## Regular Expressions

### Twitter Usernames

Pattern: `@username`

This regular expression matches Twitter usernames. The "username" can be any string of letters and digits.

### ISBN Numbers

Pattern: `ISBN xxx-x-xxx-xxxxx-x`

This regular expression matches ISBN numbers. The "x" represents a digit.

### Jokes

Pattern: `Why did the ... ? Because...`

This regular expression matches jokes. The first part of the pattern can be any string of characters, and the second part can be any string of characters.

### Weirdly Formatted Dates

Pattern: `dd-MMM-yyyy`

This regular expression matches dates in a weird format. The "dd" represents a two-digit day, the "MMM" represents a three-letter month abbreviation, and the "yyyy" represents a four-digit year.

## Implementations

- Python: The regular expressions are implemented in Python. You can find the Python scripts in the `python` directory.

- JavaScript: The regular expressions are also implemented in JavaScript. You can find the JavaScript files in the `javascript` directory.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/regex-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd regex-repository
   ```

3. Choose the implementation language (Python or JavaScript) and navigate to the corresponding directory:

   - For Python:

     ```bash
     cd python
     ```

   - For JavaScript:

     ```bash
     cd javascript
     ```

4. Run the desired script and provide input data to test the regular expressions.
